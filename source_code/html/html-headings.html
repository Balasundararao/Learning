<h2>Block Level Elements</h2>
<p>
Block elements appear on the screen as if they have a line break before and after them. 
For example the 
<em>P, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, UL, OL, DL, PRE, HR, BLOCKQUOTE, and ADDRESS</em>
elements are all block level elements. They all start on their own new line, and anything that follows them appears on its own new line.
